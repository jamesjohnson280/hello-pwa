## What It Is

A simple PWA demo that displays the text "Hello, World!" utilizing an app manifest, service workers and caching. This demo is written in plain-vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript (ES6). It has no dependencies.

I've also written a tutorial to go along with the code. Read it on Medium:

A couple of changes are needed to host this app with GitHub Pages. This is because the app is hosted from a domain subfolder.
